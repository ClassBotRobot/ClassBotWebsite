Even before the recent global school closures, there were over 750,000 persistent student absences from UK schools last year. Government research shows what a damaging impact this has on children’s education, but it doesn’t show the negative impact the isolation can have on students’ mental health and social development.

Our idea is to create a low cost remote learning classroom robot (ClassBot) which allows students to virtually present in the classroom with their friends even if they’re stuck in a hospital bed or recovering at home. Our team has developed a prototype which makes education accessible to all - so nobody needs to be left behind - for a fraction of the cost of any similar products on the market.

We’ve designed ClassBot to be a safe, secure, affordable and fun way for schools to support students who’d otherwise be isolated and we’re looking forward to sharing our vision with you.
