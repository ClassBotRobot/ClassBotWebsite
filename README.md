# ClassBotWebsite

Our idea is to create a low cost remote learning classroom robot (ClassBot) which allows students to virtually present in the classroom with their friends even if theyâ€™re stuck in a hospital bed or recovering at home. Our team has developed a prototype which makes education accessible to all - so nobody needs to be left behind - for a fraction of the cost of any similar products on the market.
